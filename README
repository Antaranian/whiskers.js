Selleck is yet another mustachioed templating library.  This (selleck.js) 
is the JavaScript version.

Selleck keeps templates simple and readable by limiting you to tags for
statements ("for" and "if"), variables, and partials.  A "for" tag loops over
items:

    {for item in items}
      <p>{item}</p>
    {/for}

An "if" tag only displays a section of the template for a truthy variable:

    {if variable}
      <p>{variable}</p>
    {/if}

As you can see, "for" and "if" tags are closed as we close HTML tags, with a
leading slash. 

Variable tags may contain no spaces, but may use dot notation:  

    {variable.property}

A partial tag is replaced by a partial sub-template at that spot in the
template:

    <div>{>partial}</div>

Templates are rendered as follows, where "template" is a string and "context"
and "partials" are objects:

    var rendered = selleck.render(template, context, partials);

See the test directory for full usage examples.
