Selleck is yet another mustachioed templating library.  This (selleck.js) 
is the JavaScript version.

For now, see the test directory for usage.

Selleck is influenced by these fine projects:
http://github.com/janl/mustache.js
http://github.com/akdubya/dustjs
http://github.com/andychu/json-template
http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/templates/
